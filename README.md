# Java implemention of miniFlow

This project is created for learning purpose. The original implementation is python based provided by udacity, added here as well under python/ directory for reference.

This implemention doesn't rely on any third party libraries, it also includes "boston house price" sample data embedded in the java file. No need to install any environment or tools, Just click run in Java IDE.

As java enforce the data type, so it is easier to read through and understand the data type of "values" or "gradients", which I found often confusing in python.
